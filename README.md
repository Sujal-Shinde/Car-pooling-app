A carpooling system, often referred to as a ridesharing system, is a transportation concept that has gained
prominence in recent years as a sustainable and efficient means of reducing traffic congestion, lowering
emissions, and optimizing the use of vehicles. This system connects individuals who share similar travel routes
and allows them to share rides, either in their own cars or in vehicles provided by ride-sharing platforms.
Ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft have revolutionized urban mobility by leveraging technology to
match drivers and passengers, providing a cost-effective and convenient alternative to traditional taxi services.
Carpooling not only reduces the number of vehicles on the road but also promotes social and environmental
benefits, contributing to reduced carbon emissions and alleviating the strain on urban infrastructure. As
urbanization and concerns about environmental impact continue to grow, ride-sharing systems play a crucial
role in addressing these challenges and shaping the future of transportation.
